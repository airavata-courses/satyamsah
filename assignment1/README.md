![alt text](https://github.com/airavata-courses/satyamsah/blob/master/assignment1/workflowdiagram.PNG)
## Description
It is microservice architecture using 3 service. In this project we are assuming that an employee working in a department will have same salary as the other employee working in the same department with same designation.So we can fetch the salary of the employee using the mapping of department and employee :
1) #### [onboarding an employee service](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/tree/master/employee-onboard-service-javaspring): 
   It is used to register an employee . It will ask for basic info of new employee: Name,Designation, Department,Gender. It is written is "java-spring-boot"
2) #### [department-salary service](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/tree/master/create-deptmentandsalary-service-python):
   It is use to invoke POST operation to create a table. It will have department, designation and salary. It means employees with same  designation in the same department will have same salary. It is written in "python and flask"
3) #### [getting the salary of an employee service](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/tree/master/fetch-salary-service-nodejs): 
   While entering the employee Id you will get the salary of that employee.Its starting point is java-spring which is calling a service    in "node-js" service to retrive the information of salary


## Pre- requisite 
1)  install java 8 using this [link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and configure      the classpath
2) install [mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
3) install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
4) install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
5) type `pip install flask`  on terminal/commandline to install [flask](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask) 
6) type `pip install PyMySQL` or `sudo apt-get install python3-pymysql` in ubuntu to [install python msql connector](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyMySQL/0.7.6)

6) install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or in ubuntu type `sudo apt-get install nodejs`
7. confirm that nodjs has been installed by typing `node --version` on terminal/commandline
8. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or in ubunut type `sudo apt-get install npm` 
9. Check whether NPM is succesfully installed has been installed by typing `npm --version` on terminal/commandline

## Database and tables:
Create the 2 databases and 2 tables for employee and salaryslab by excuting the mysql scripts.To do so, install any mysql client preferebly [mysql workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench) to run mysql scripts below:

1) [create-employee.sql](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/blob/master/sqlscript/create-employee.sql) : It is creating employee table to store emp id,name, dept,gender . 
2) [create-salaryslab.sql](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/blob/master/sqlscript/create-salaryslab.sql) : It is creating a salaryslab table with dept , deignation and salary as columns.The reason is to create a relation between department and designation to map them to fixed salary.It means employees with same designation in the same department will have same salary.


## Booting the micoservices :
1) ##### onboarding an employee service(java spring boot):
   Run the jar located [employee-onboard-service-javaspring](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/blob/master/employee-onboard-service-javaspring/target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar). It will run this service at port 8080:
   
   type `java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` to boot the server

2) ##### department-salary service( python-flask): 
   we can enable this service by changing directory to [create-deptmentandsalary-service-python](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/blob/master/create-deptmentandsalary-service-python) and run salary.py.It will run the          service in port 5002:

   type `python salary.py` to boot the server

3) ##### getting the salary of an employee service (nodejs):
   You can change directory to [fetch-salary-service-nodej](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/tree/master/fetch-salary-service-nodejs). 

    a) type npm install on terminal/commandline which will download all the dependenies specified in [package.json]
   
    b) type node server.js to boot the server

# consuming the micoservies using UI
we can access the link [here](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/tree/master/web) to access the web UI

1) [Welcome.html](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/blob/master/web/Welcome.html) : Welcome link for all the services

2) [addemployee.html](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/blob/master/web/addemployee.html) : It will ask for basic info of new employee: Name,Designation, Department,Gender. It will save the information in the employee table

3) [addSalarySlab.html](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/blob/master/web/addSalarySlab.html) : It will ask for Department, Designation and Salary assigned. The salary is mapped to dept and designation. It will save the information in the salaryslab table.

4) [FindSalary.html](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/blob/master/web/FindSalary.html) : It will ask for Employee id to fetch the salary of the employee. Only numeric values are allowed. It will contact both the employee table and  salaryslab table. The employee id is auto-genreted numeric and is hidden from user's input. It starts from 1.

#### Note : 

1) So as to get proper flow thr whole project , one needs to enter proper entry in [addemployee.html](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/blob/master/web/addemployee.html) 

   First Name : Kumar  
   Gender : Male  
   Department : IT  
   Designation: SDE1  

2) And the same kind of entry in the [addSalarySlab.html](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/blob/master/web/addSalarySlab.html):

   Designation: SDE1  
   Department : IT  
   Salary: 20000  

3) Now,when navigate to [FindSalary.html](https://github.com/satyamsah/microservice/blob/master/web/FindSalary.html) and enter:

   Enter employee Id:(only numeric): 1  



   It will fetch you the salary.
